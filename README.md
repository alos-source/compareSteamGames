# compareSteamGames
## Description
This Python Script reads games owned by different users from their Steam community pages and generates a list of common games. Script runs offline on the computer. Steam HTML-Files have to be downloaded to computer in advance.

## Motivation
I've got a large number of games gathered in my Steam library, and want to know which i could play in multiplayer with two or three friends. Unfortunatelly, Steam only displayes common games for one friend. So comparing and finding matches in multiple large Steam libraries becomes a time consuming task.

## Prerequisits
Created for Python 3.9.
Steam-Pages need to be downloaded as HTML and placed in HTML-Folder. File can be downloaded from friends community page like: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/XXXXXX/games/?tab=all where XXXXXX represents a Steam-ID.
